Input:
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case has two lines:
	The first line has an integer N, which is the length of the input in next line.
	The second line has N integers separated with a space, where -1 is used to indicate an absence of node and the others are the keys for the binary tree.
